BITS 


No, it is not compulsory to write the GATE exam to get admission into BITS Pilani for certain postgraduate programs, such as MTech.

BITS Pilani conducts its own entrance test, the BITS HD (Higher Degree) admission test, for admission into M.Tech and other higher degree programs. The GATE exam score may also be considered for admission, but it's not the only route. Applicants can choose to apply either through GATE scores or by appearing for the BITS HD exam, depending on their preferences.

For the MTech in Data Science and Engineering, which you mentioned earlier, you can check the specific admission criteria on their official website to confirm if the program accepts BITS HD exam scores, GATE scores, or both.


HOW TO GET INTO IT BITS 

To get into the M.E. in Computer Science program at BITS Goa, the admission process is similar to that of other higher degree programs at BITS Pilani. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Eligibility Criteria
Educational Qualification: You should have a B.E./B.Tech degree in Computer Science, Information Technology, or a related field.
Minimum Marks: Generally, a minimum aggregate of 60% or 6 CGPA in your undergraduate degree is required.

The BITS HD exam is conducted specifically for admission into higher degree (M.E./MTech) programs.
The test is divided into two sections:
Part 1: General aptitude, which includes English, logical reasoning, and basic mathematics.
Part 2: Subject-specific questions related to Computer Science and Engineering.
b. GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) Score:

If you have a valid GATE score in Computer Science (CS), you can apply based on that score.
Candidates with strong GATE scores might receive preference or direct admission, but the cut-offs may vary.
3. Application Process
Apply Online:
Go to the official BITS Pilani admissions portal and fill out the application form. Specify the program (M.E. in Computer Science) and the campus (BITS Goa).
