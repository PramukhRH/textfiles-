Digital Twin for Personal Health

Problem: Health monitoring apps exist, but none create a digital twin that simulates potential future health based on lifestyle choices.

Solution: An app that creates a "digital twin" of a personâ€™s health based on their data (sleep, diet, exercise). The app could simulate health consequences based on hypothetical scenarios, like poor sleep patterns or irregular diets, to help users make better decisions.

Public Transport Crowding Indicator

Problem: Crowded public transportation systems, especially in metro cities.

Solution: A real-time web app that shows crowd levels in buses, trains, and metros using sensors, user input, and GPS data. Users can plan their commute based on crowd levels to avoid congestion.
Why it's needed: Indian cities suffer from overcrowded public transportation, and this app would improve commuter experience.

Personalized Nutrition and Food Subscription Service

Problem: Lack of customized, affordable nutrition plans.

Solution: A web and mobile app that analyzes users' dietary needs based on health data (such as medical history, fitness goals) and offers personalized meal plans. Users can subscribe to receive meals delivered to their homes, tailored for specific health goals (e.g., diabetes, weight loss).
Why it's needed: With the growing health awareness in India, a service that provides affordable and customized meal plans can cater to health-conscious individuals.
