For GATE 2025 (Computer Science)
1. Understand the Syllabus & Exam Pattern
Subjects to Focus on:

Discrete Mathematics
Data Structures and Algorithms
Operating Systems
Computer Networks
Databases (DBMS)
Theory of Computation
Compiler Design
Digital Logic
Software Engineering
General Aptitude
Weightage of Subjects:

General Aptitude: 15%
Engineering Mathematics: 15%
Core CS Subjects: 70%
2. Create a Study Plan
Time Allocation:
Dedicate at least 6–8 months for focused preparation.
Weekly Goals: Cover at least one subject every 1.5-2 weeks.
Daily Study Routine:
4-6 hours/day: Break down into 2-3 sessions focusing on different subjects.
Include 1 hour for problem-solving and previous year questions daily.
Revision: Revise topics every weekend to avoid forgetting concepts.
3. Study Resources
Books:
Data Structures & Algorithms: “Introduction to Algorithms” by Cormen.
Operating Systems: “Operating System Concepts” by Galvin.
Networks: “Computer Networking” by Tanenbaum.
Theory of Computation: “Introduction to Automata Theory” by Hopcroft.
Databases: “Database System Concepts” by Korth.
Online Platforms & Courses:
NPTEL: Free lectures on various topics.
GeeksforGeeks, TutorialsPoint: For coding and theory-based articles.
GATE Academy, Made Easy: Both provide online test series and video lectures.
4. Solve Previous Year Papers & Take Mock Tests
Solving previous 10 years’ GATE papers helps you understand the exam pattern.
Test Series: Enroll in an online test series (e.g., Made Easy, GATE Academy). Start taking mock tests at least 3 months before the exam.
Analyze: After each mock test, analyze your mistakes and weak areas.
5. Time Management and Practice
Accuracy: Focus on improving both accuracy and speed. GATE is about solving problems with a deep understanding of concepts.
Focus on Weak Areas: Regularly revisit tough topics and strengthen your basics in mathematics and problem-solving.
6. Tips for the General Aptitude Section
Practice verbal ability (synonyms, antonyms, sentence completion) and numerical ability (logical reasoning, arithmetic).
This section is easy but contributes 15%, so don't neglect it.
For BITS HD (Higher Degree Test)
1. Understand the Exam Pattern
Part A: General Aptitude (30 minutes, 45 questions)
Verbal ability, logical reasoning, and mathematics.
Part B: Subject-Specific (105 minutes, 70 questions)
Computer Science topics similar to GATE but slightly less complex.
2. Focus on Key Topics
Similar to GATE, BITS HD also emphasizes:
Data Structures and Algorithms
Operating Systems
Computer Networks
DBMS
Software Engineering
The questions are concept-driven but slightly easier than GATE.
3. Aptitude Section Preparation
For Part A, focus on:
Logical Reasoning: Practice puzzles and reasoning questions (can use books like RS Aggarwal).
Mathematics: Cover basic concepts from high school math like trigonometry, algebra, and probability.
Verbal Ability: Work on reading comprehension and vocabulary.
4. Mock Tests for BITS HD
Enroll in mock tests specifically designed for BITS HD (many coaching platforms offer them).
Focus on time management as the BITS HD exam has a different structure and timing from GATE.
5. General Preparation Tips for BITS HD
Cover Concepts from GATE Preparation: Since the syllabus overlaps, GATE preparation will also help you perform well in BITS HD.
Solve Previous Year Papers: Not as many resources are available for BITS HD as for GATE, but you can still practice with the BITS Pilani sample papers provided on their official site.
Additional Tips for Both Exams
Regular Revision: Keep revising the concepts. Make short notes for last-minute revision.
Healthy Routine: Balance study with breaks, exercise, and proper sleep.
Motivation: Keep yourself motivated by setting short-term goals. Reward yourself for achieving them.
Peer Discussion: Join online forums or study groups to discuss doubts and exchange preparation strategies.
Consistency is Key: Dedicate time every day, even if it’s just for revision or solving a few problems.
Study Plan Overview:
Months 1-3: Concept building for all major subjects.
Months 4-6: Problem-solving, previous papers, and mock tests.
Months 7-8: Full mock tests and final revisions.
